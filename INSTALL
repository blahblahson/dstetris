Running
_________

To run this you will need a device which allows you to play homebrew stuff on
your DS - a SLOT-1 or SLOT-2 card of some kind is fine. Put the respective
binary (ending in .ds.gba, .nds or .sc.nds) on the device and launch it how you
would other homebrew or official game ROMs. If you want to get one of these
devices, I suggest an R4 or M3 (they're basically the same thing, but the R4 is
slightly cheaper).

The binaries are located in dist/.

Compiling
_________

To compile, run make. This will compile dstetris, along with aslib (found in
src/aslib and src/arm7). You should have a devkitARM environment set up. Required libraries are libnds
and uLibrary. $DEVKITPRO should point to your devkitpro root (e.g.
/opt/devkitpro), and $DEVKITARM should point to your devkitARM root (e.g.
/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM). It won't work without these set.

For those who don't have devkitARM environments or don't need to compile it
themselves (there is very little reason to), I have included pre-build Nintendo
DS binaries:
    dstetris.ds.gba
    dstetris.nds
    dstetris.sc.nds

The only real reason to compile right now (other than changing the code) is to
change the square graphic (data/square.png), since I have it compiled-in for
now. This should be selectable without recompilation in future. If you change
the graphic, make sure it is grey-ish, since dstetris tints the color
accordingly (notice there is only one graphic and various colors).
