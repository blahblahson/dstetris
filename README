dstetris-1.0.0
______________

So here's my Tetris for DS which is completely free (see COPYING). It is also
free from all the stupid stuff Nintendo ruined Tetris DS with:
    - Just because it has two screens doesn't mean the other screen needs to be
      distracting.
    - Storing blocks is stupid (L on Standard mode), if you use it you suck.
    - Previews of 35235138 blocks is stupid, too.
    - The music sucks until you get 200 lines.
    - You can't switch off any of these annoying features.

I wrote dstetris for myself so I didn't need to keep up with all the
aforementioned crap. It has all the features as the Standard mode in Tetris DS,
is SRS (Super Rotation System) compliant and also fixes some of the annoying
things in Tetris DS which are more subtle (namely gravity being calculated
before movement on 20G
[http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/index.php?title=SRS#20G]).

However, dstetris sacrifices fancy effects, aesthetics and good menu-interfaces
because it is more to the point, and I find that better. If you want all the
sugar coated crap Nintendo ships on Tetris DS, then I suggest you buy it.
Although it is annoying, it's a very good version of Tetris and definitely
worth the $5 you could get it for now if you want fancy menus and more features
(one of the puzzle modes is actually good).

The game itself is straightforward if you know how to play Tetris. If you
don't, figure it out. The menus suck due to my laziness, but they are perfectly
functional and not poorly written - if I had spend 2 more minutes making the
options selectable with the D-pad, it would have turned out to be really badly
written.

IMPORTANT! The default random seed for dstetris is 7525. Every game it will
change, but by the same extent. In effect, it means every person will have the
exact same order of blocks when they run the precompiled executable with no
modifications. When you first run the game, go to configuration -> random seed
and set it to something random which it isn't at the moment. This will ensure
that your order of blocks is different from the order that comes to start with.
Every time a block is generated, it also generates a new random seed, so you
should only have to set it once. DO NOT change the random seed in confgen
unless you have good reason to - it's a waste of your time and can only cause
problems. For more information on configuration, see config-options.
