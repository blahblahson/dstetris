dstetris is very configurable in comparison to other versions if Tetris such as
Tetris DS. If controls feel incorrect, you can usually refine them in the
configuration menu. Press START on the main screen and follow the menus to set
various options. Below is a description of every option with rationale,
suggestions and such for some.
__________

* Level
    - Limit: 1-20

      The level defines how quickly the blocks fall. 1 is the slowest (and
    I have been told is too slow even by people who suck at Tetris), while 20
    is instant-flooring (that is, appearing at the bottom on spawn).
      Internally level is measured in how many 1/60th seconds pass until the
    block moves down by 1 on the y axis. Specifically, with the exception of
    level 20, it is calculated as [5(20-level)], and 20 being handled slightly
    differently to the rest. That means level 1 is 5(19), or 95 1/60th seconds.
__________

* Level Increment
    - Limit: 1-100
    - Unit:  lines

      Part of the challenge in Tetris is keeping up with the increasing level.
    The level increment defines how many lines must be cleared to afvance a
    level. Levels do not advance past 20. On Tetris DS, this option is 10,
    which is a good number.
__________

* Infinity
    - Limit: 0-600

      `Infinity' is the name given by the Tetris Company for the delay until
    blocks lock. dstetris measures this in 1/60th seconds, and the delay is
    activated when the block is floored and has ceased to move. Moving the
    block (either with D-pad or with rotation, provided it actually moves)
    resets this delay. 20 is a somewhat normal delay, but it can be set to
    anything from 0 to 600, 600 being somewhat unplayable (I just set 600 as a
    logical maximum). 0 will lock it as soon as it connects with the floor.
__________

* Delayed Auto Shift (DAS)
    - Limit: 0-600

      Delayed auto shift is the delay between holding down a direction and the
    block actually moving. A single press moves the block 1 space in the given
    direction, followed by this delay, and then it moves at the shift speed
    while the direction is held. The delay is measured in 1/60th seconds also,
    with 0 being an instant transformation (0 will give you some trouble when
    moving the block by 1 space only). 600 is far too much, just like 600
    infinity.
__________

* Shift speed
    - Limit: 1-512

      Shift speed is the speed at which a block moves when held (after the DAS).
      It is measured differently from most other options. Since the DS sucks at
    floating point, I use `fixed point' values to define non-integer values.
    Since the shift speed is often a non-integer, it is measured like this.
    Without going into the details, consider that 256 equates to one pixel of
    movement. Similarly, 512 is 2, and 128 0.5.
__________

* Random seed
    - Limit: 0-inf

      The limit is actually that of an unsigend int, but it's much easier to
    just say infinity (it basically is). This option only really needs to be
    set once and once only by a normal player, but it must be set in most
    cases.
      The random seed is a number which fuels the randomizer, to be precise.
    The default value, 7816, will always produce the same order of blocks on
    every system unless you change the seed. Once it is set the game will
    continue to update the seed itself randomly. Instead of going into detail,
    just hold down L or R on this menu for a while until you get a number which
    seems adequate. That should be enough normally and you will never need to
    do it again unless under special circumstances.
